                <li>The Indian Forest Act, 1927 provides the legal framework for the management of forests in India. It is the foremost guiding legislation in forestry. The objective of this piece of legislation is to ensure:</li>
                <li>consolidation and preservation of areas with forest cover</li>
                <li>conservation of forest areas with wildlife</li>
                <li>regulate the movement of forest resources</li>
                <li>levy duty on timber and other resources and other forest produce</li>
                <li>categorization of areas into Reserved Forest, Protected Forest and Village Forests</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The Forest Conservation Act, 1980 focuses on the diversion of forest areas for non-forestry purposes. The State government acts as the enforcing authority for all requests and proposals to use forest land for development and infrastructure building such as providing drinking water, irrigation projects, transmission lines, railway, power, defence, mining etc.</li>
                <li>The Act also provides that for all forest land lost to such developmentâ€“compensatory afforestation, catchment area treatment, biodiversity and wildlife conservation, rehabilitation of tribal communities living on forest lands are matters that should be addressed by the state and other parties involved.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The policy lays emphasis on the concept of Joint Forest Management where villages and the relevant forest department manage specific forest blocks together to:</li>
                <li>meet the basic needs of rural and tribal populations,</li>
                <li>increase forest productivity</li>
                <li>improve the efficiency of forest product utilization</li>
                <li>minimize pressure on existing forests</li>
                <li>The Joint Forest Management scheme is perhaps the best and most effective strategy to have emerged from the National Forestry Policy with 85, 000 village committees set up across 27 Indian states managing 17.3 million hectares of forest land under them.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>This Act focuses on the protecting wild animals, plants and tree species and makes hunting and collecting such animals and plants in protected areas a criminal offence.</li>
                <li>Bodies like the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the Tiger and Other Endangered Species Crime Control Bureau (Wildlife Crime Control Bureau).</li>
                <li>
                    The Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 is a comprehensive legislation enacted by the Government of India aimed at protecting wildlife and conserving biodiversity in the country. It replaced the earlier Wild Birds and Animals Protection Act of 1912. The Wildlife Protection Act provides legal protection to wild animals, birds, and plants, as well as their habitats.</li>

        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>This Act came into the play to exclusively grant rights and concessions and to protect the way of life of forest-dependent communities that depend on forests for their daily subsistence their livelihoods.</li>
                <li>The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, commonly known as the Forest Rights Act (FRA), is an Indian law enacted to recognize and vest the forest rights and occupation in forest land in forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes (STs) and other traditional forest dwellers (OTFDs) who have been residing in such forests for generations but whose rights could not be recorded.</li>
                <li>The Act aimed to correct the historical injustice meted out to these communities by recognizing their rights to forest land and resources. It provides a framework for granting individual and community forest rights, including the right to cultivate land, collect minor forest produce, and access to water bodies among others.</li>
